dsCrypt is a file encryption program.



USAGE

dsc keyfile e|d source destination

Keyfile must contain 64 hexadecimal bytes.
Encryption example: dsc a:\my.key e d:\x\data.zip data.enc
Decryption example: dsc my.key d data.enc c:\tmp\data.zip

"C:\Users\chmitro\Desktop\EncDec\dsc.exe" "C:\Users\chmitro\Desktop\EncDec\test.key" e "C:\Matt.jpg" "C:\Matt.enc"

"C:\Users\chmitro\Desktop\EncDec\dsc.exe" "C:\Users\chmitro\Desktop\EncDec\test.key" e "C:\All\a.txt" "C:\All\a.enc"

"C:\Users\chmitro\Desktop\EncDec\dsc.exe" "C:\Users\chmitro\Desktop\EncDec\test.key" d "C:\All\a.enc" "C:\All\a2.txt"

NOTES

Use double-quotes for file names with spaces.

Press Ctrl+C to abort processing, then manually delete leftover files.

The best way to create a key file is to run dsCrypt-GUI, enter a password and
press F4 (v1.10+). All files encrypted with the GUI version can be decrypted
with the CLI version. Files encrypted with the CLI version can be decrypted
with the GUI version if CRC is not used (v1.10+). Passfiles and keyfiles are
closely related but not compatible and you will need to press F4 and save a
keyfile after opening a passfile to ensure proper encryption or decryption of
CLI/GUI files. BTW, since the keyfiles are hexadecimal, they can be archived
in text files using eg. Notepad.

The best performance is achieved when source and destination files are on
physically separate drives.



MULTI-FILE PROCESSING

Create the following file and folder structure:

dsc.exe
my.key
TMP\ (folder for processed files)
   |
   |-file-for-encryption
   |-file-for-encryption
   |-...
   |-TMP\ (sub-folder for encrypted files)

then type on the command-line:
for %f in (tmp\*.*) do dsc my.key e "%f" "tmp\%f"


If you prefer to add and remove the "dsc" extension when en/de/crypting,
try the following W2k/XP batch script (thanks to Sebastian Juergens).

----------batchdsc.cmd----------
@echo off
setlocal

if not exist tmp\tmp md tmp\tmp
if "%1"=="e" goto _encryption
if "%1"=="d" goto _decryption
echo.
echo Usage: batchdsc e^|d
goto _end

:_encryption
for %%f in (tmp\*.*) do dsc my.key e "%%f" "tmp\%%f.dsc"
goto _end

:_decryption
for %%f in (tmp\*.dsc) do call :_sub_decryption "%%f"
goto _end

:_sub_decryption
  set _decrypted_file=%1
  set _decrypted_file=%_decrypted_file:"=%
  set _decrypted_file="tmp\%_decrypted_file:~0,-4%"
  dsc my.key d %1 %_decrypted_file%
goto :eof

:_end
endlocal
----------batchdsc.cmd----------



IMPLEMENTATION

Cipher: AES (Rijndael)
Mode: CBC
Key: 256 bit
IV: 16 bytes
Max File Size: 2GB
Cipher File Structure:
[cipherdata] + [padding <= 16 bytes] + [IV = 16 random bytes]
