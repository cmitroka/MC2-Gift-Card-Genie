        Welcome to gift card genie!</h2>
    Thanks for stopping by.&nbsp; As you&#39;ve probably noticed, this isn&#39;t 
software written by a company with a team of people, it&#39;s just my hobby project.&nbsp; 
Have a look around and leave us some

Here&#39;s a little about the app:<br />
<table border="1" class="style2">
    <tr>
        <td style="vertical-align: top;">
            <p class="MsoNormal">
                Want to know the balance of your gift card without making a phone call?<o:p></o:p></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">
                Gift Card Genie (GCG) allows you to check the balance of your gift cards in real 
                time, so you never have to manually keep track.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                </span>The application is simple:<o:p></o:p></p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p class="MsoNormal">
                        Enter you gift card type (this is the mechant)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="MsoNormal">
&nbsp;Enter the card number</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="MsoNormal">
                        If the card has a PIN or Access number, enter it as well</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p class="MsoNormal">
                        Get the balance</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p class="MsoNormal">
                <o:p></o:p>
                The best part is GCG can handle gift cards from multiple mechants – no need for 
                dozens of specific apps.<o:p></o:p></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">
                You can either then save the data so it doesn’t have to be entered again, or 
                just get the balance and exit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If 
                you save the data, it will be titled as the gift cards type, followed by the 
                last 4 digits – making balance retrieval quick and easy.<span 
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There’s no limit to the amount of 
                cards you can have saved either.<o:p></o:p></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">
                We’re adding new mechants every day, and as they become available, GCG will 
                immediately be able to use them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>
                Alongside balance, other information (such as expiration date) may also be 
                retrievable if supplied by the merchant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                </span>Since the content comes from them, it just has to be relayed back to you.<o:p></o:p></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">
                To find out what mechants are currently supported, please visit our website.<span 
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If you would like to see a mechant 
                added, send us a request and we’ll do our best to make it happen.<span 
                    style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unless a mechant specifically asks 
                or prevents us from balance retrieval, new cards can usually be added within a 
                day.<o:p></o:p></p>
