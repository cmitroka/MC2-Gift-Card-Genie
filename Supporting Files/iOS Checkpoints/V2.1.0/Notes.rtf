\f0\fs24 \cf0 Chris LaGarde, Jeff Chesbro and Jason Gait, my app has been submitted to apple and will probably be available for download/sale next week.  If you could each do a quick run of the app and let me know if you experience any crashes, I can get them fixed prior to Apple seeing them.  Thanks guys, let me know!}
